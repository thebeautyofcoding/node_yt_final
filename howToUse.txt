1. Preperationwork: Log into https://console.cloud.google.com/ and create a project, create an API-key, which you add into your .env file (API_KEY=gkjkfjgkfgkfgfk) in the root of this project. Also, create OAuth 2.0-Client-Id and download it as JSON and
just copy paste it into client_secret.json in the root. Create a test user, which is you, just use your gmail.
Don't forget to activate the youtubeApi there. Also register an authorized redirect URI, that will be http://localhost:3001/ or whatever you use as localdevelopment environment
Install all needed dependencies via : "npm install"

2. Now you should be done with preperation work.


3.Now you can run: "node script.js download some-channel-id"  You always get the channelId  when you are on a youtube video and then click on the channel below the video.  What this script will do now, is, get the first 50 videos, if this channel has got 50, otherwise ofc less than 50. You can see them in videos.json in the root.... but thats not so important. Then it will randomly pick one, download it and its thumbnails. 

4. Nothing else to do, trimming and uploading is handled after the download has been finished.


4. Hope you are happy with the work. In case, you have problems or you do not like something, let me know :)
